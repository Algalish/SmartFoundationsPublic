# Smart!

![multiplayer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deantendo/community/master/com_mp_yes.png)

## Introduction

Smart! is _the_ Swiss Army knife of your factory building dreams! There are a few key areas where we can help you take your factory building to the next level!

### Foundations, Walls, Ramps

Smart! will allow you to build entire foundations, walls, and ramps in a single click. Go from building each foundation, wall, and ramp individually to laying them out 100 by 100 if you'd like! (and you have enough space for that much concrete!)

### Buildings

Smart! has fine control tools allowing you to create entire rows of buildings, carefully spaced apart to allow you to sneak belts or poles between them, consistently! (if you're into making pretty patterns with your layouts!)

### Belts, Mergers, Splitters, Stack

Smart! makes it easy to layout and space all manner of item transportation. With auto-snapping belts you can even lay down a row of splitters that auto-connect to themselves and the closest machines! (unless you enjoy the alignment game with splitters and mergers...)

## Controls

Smart! has a simple button layout, and lots of visual helpers. We don't require that you build any special tools, unlock any special recipe, or make you use custom foundations or buildings. We extend the base functionality of the game, we don't rebuild it!

Our button layout is:

<center>

|button|modifiers|effect|
|---|:-:|--:|
| __Left__ *Shift* | must be held + scroll | increase/decrease count along the x axis |
| __Left__ *Alt* | must be held + scroll | increase/decrease count along the y axis |
| __Left__ *Alt* + __Left__ *Shift* | must be held + scroll | increase/decrease count along the z axis |
| __Scroll Wheel__ | any key | increases or decreases the key selected |
| __U__ | must be held + scroll | increase/decrease steps up/down |
| __T__ | must be held + scroll | increase/decrease swirl left/right |
| __L__ | must be held + scroll | increase/decrease levitation up/down |
| __P__ | must be held + scroll | increase/decrease spacing between items |
| __H__ | toggle | lock building position to inspect |
| __M__ | toggle | toggle settings screen |

## Known-bugs
* __Auto-connecting poles with belts may crash so please save the game and reload it after you built those long belts and before pushing items to there.__
* __On Epic settings are not saved/loaded but on Steam it works__
