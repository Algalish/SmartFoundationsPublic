This issue tracker is for issues(errors/bugs) only.

Please suggest new features in discord and keep track of open feature-requests there. Then either me or community manager will put it into a special channel where people could vote with "thumbs ups".

Why, why having issues here at github and feature-requests at discord?
Because when I'll be creating new features - I will first develop the feature with the most likes - its as simple as that!
